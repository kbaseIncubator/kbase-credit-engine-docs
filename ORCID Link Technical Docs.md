# ORCID Link Technical Docs

An ORCID Link allows KBase to perform certain actions against the ORCID API on behalf of a user.

## TODO

There is always lots to do, this is the short list:

- split the start linking process page into two columns.
  
  - First column for the primary action
  
  - second column has faq including "What if I don't have an ORCID Account?", and a link to ORCID to create an account if they need to

- create faq page? or leave that to the docs site?

- do we need admin and/or reporting in the api?

- begin documenting api

- another pass through the api to modularize it
